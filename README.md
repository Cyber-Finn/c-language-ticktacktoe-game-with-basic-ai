# Tick-TackToe-game
A C (language) tick-tack-toe game that has some very basic AI (Still manages to beat me most rounds though!). 
<br> 
Should be run from command-prompt/command-line-interface in its as-is form

## Notes:
1. The application's .exe file is already built and included here - but I'd advise against downloading and running random .exes from the internet, especially when you've got the source-code right in front of you.
2. Xs represent your moves, 0s represent the AI/ghost player's moves.
